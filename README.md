 Analytical Bot - News Research Tool

Title: Analytical Bot: News Research Tool ðŸ“ˆ

Objective: To create an interactive web tool for analyzing news articles by extracting text from provided URLs, processing the content, and enabling users to ask questions related to the articles.

Key Components:

Technologies and Libraries: Utilizes Streamlit for the user interface, integrates various language processing libraries from the 'langchain' module (like text splitter, document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores), as well as Google Generative AI for conversational capabilities.
User Interface: Employs a Streamlit layout with a sidebar for entering up to three URLs of news articles. Users can trigger the processing of these URLs by clicking a button.
Data Processing: Loads article content from provided URLs, splits the text into smaller chunks for analysis, generates embeddings using Hugging Face models, and creates a FAISS index for similarity search.
Question-Answering: Allows users to input questions related to the articles. The application employs a Google Generative AI model to find relevant answers from the processed article data.
Display of Results: Displays the answers to user questions along with the sources, if available, retrieved from the processed articles.
Functionalities:

Input: Accepts up to three URLs of news articles.
Processing: Extracts and processes text data from the articles, performs text splitting and embedding generation, and stores the embeddings in a FAISS index.
Interaction: Allows users to input questions related to the articles for the bot to answer.
Output: Shows the bot's answers to user questions and provides sources when available.
Potential Improvements:

Error handling and input validation enhancements.
Additional features for better user interaction and feedback.
Further optimization for larger-scale article processing and faster response times.
This summary highlights the key aspects of the project based on the provided code snippet, showcasing its functionalities and aims in building an analytical tool for news article analysis and question-answering.
